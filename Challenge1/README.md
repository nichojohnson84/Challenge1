# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

For this project we were asked to do a common task for someone in web development and refactor page's code.
We were given specific criteria to meet which is as follows.

Get rid of non-semantic elements of code 
    and this is where I struggled the most and will likely get tutoring.  Basically it was as our module called it "div soup".  You want everything to have meaning and be more concise so that it is easy to find and maintain.  I could not get rid or change things without the whole page going haywire and for some reason it was specifically the images that became enormous once I submitted a change but I got to a point where I felt like I had done all I could.

Make sure that the elements follow a logical structure 
    and I feel like I somewhat accomplished this but not being able to do the first task made this one difficult.
    
Make sure that all photo's have alt atributes and I did make sure this was accomplished.

Make sure the pages follows a sequential order and I think this was completed

Give the page a title that will help when searching and I believe this was completed as well.

It was then up to us to make sure we know how to upload our files to github and publish them so that it looks like it is coming from a real website rather than a file drive on my computer.

The main thing I learned from this is that I need a lot more work at semantics  I knew what I wanted to do and wanted it to look like but couldn't make the necessary changes.  Hopefully as time goes by and with practice this will come more naturally.
